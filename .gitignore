BIG LIST: 3. Create a `Flight` Model with the following properties (in lab planner)  -DONE (but did not IMPORT anywhere yet - controller)

4. Implement the following User Stories:

    - AAU, I want to create a flight by entering the information on a `new` view that has a form. When I submit the form I should be taken back to all the flights.
      1. first request displays form for user, 2. 2nd request to submit form to server, where data is created, - 5 STEPS FOR EACH!

      -DONE - FIX DEFAULT VALUES!!?!

    - AAU, I want to be able to access each view via a navigation bar at the top of the page with links to:
        - `ALL FLIGHTS`, and
        - `ADD FLIGHT`  
          -GOT PARTIALL SET UP
    - AAU, I want to be able to delete a flight from the list on the `index` view.
    - AAU, I want to be able to click on a flight to view its details on a `show` view.
    - AAU, I want to be able to click a button WITHIN the `show` view that brings me to an `edit` view where I can adjust a flight’s details.  When I save these changes, they should persist to the database and redirect me back to the flight’s `show` view.
  -ME - eventually replace favicon!  remove 'users' stuff if not needed.


NEXT PUSH
5-steps for 'new flight' Form Submission - 1 POST & redirect to /movies index ejs, 2 add UI/form in new.ejs, 3 define route in router, 4 add controller & export, 5 fill in controller for CRUD action - 'default values' in form still not working correctly
  -NOTE default "den" not working
